Project Introduction:

ITots is an application for any day care center. As parents, what is it that we are looking for while opting for a day care center for your little one? 

The main aspects that one would be looking for are:

• Security of the child

• Learning

ITots is an app that provides both these features. The security is taken care of by allowing the parent to upload pictures of the people who are authorized to pick up the child. At the center, a picture is taken and a facial comparison is done to ensure that each child is being picked up by the authorized person.

Any parent, would love it if their child can learn some basic things while at the day care center. For this we have language and learning courses to teach the child. Since this is catered for very young children, the teaching is done using audio and images.
